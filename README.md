# multiaddon
We made an extension which is a combination of many extensions like time tracker, weather report etc. This will help people save their time in many ways. There are 10 modules added in just one extension which can replace all other extensions. 
The modules are:
1.	Weather Report – This add-on will keep you informed about the weather around you all the time with just one click.
Features
•	Icon live updates with current weather
•	Current weather
•	12h forecast
•	5 day forecast
•	Choose between metric or imperial units
•	Search over 200 000 cities worldwide
•	Built using the OpenWeatherMap API

2.	AdBlock – AdBlocker Ultimate is designed with a single purpose in mind to remove all ads and focus your attention on the content you want.
Features
•	Remove all ads
•	Block malware and tracking
•	Improve browser performance
•	No "acceptable" ads or whitelisted websites/ad networks

3.	Screenshots – The simplest way to take a full page screenshot of your current browser window. Click on the extension in your browser bar, watch the extension capture each part of the page, and be transported to a new tab of your image that you can right-click to save-as or just drag to your desktop. No bloat, no ads, just a simple way to turn a full web page into an image.
